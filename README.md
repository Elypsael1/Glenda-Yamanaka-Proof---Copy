### 🧬 Computational Stabilization of Reprogramming Factors

**Project Glenda Volume 1** is a computationally engineered polycistronic fusion protein designed to induce cellular pluripotency (iPSC generation) with superior stability and safety profiles compared to standard "Yamanaka Factors."

This repository contains the **Cryptographic Verification Package**. It proves the existence, stability, and biophysical validity of the construct *without* disclosing the proprietary amino acid sequence.

## 🧪 Executive Summary

Standard reprogramming vectors often suffer from "Stochastic Imbalance" (uneven factor delivery) and oncogenic risk (c-MYC). 

**The Solution:** An engineered fusion of **OCT4-SOX2-KLF4-LMYC** linked by optimized glycine-serine chains.
* **Stoichiometry:** Enforced 1:1:1:1 ratio via physical linkage.
* **Safety:** Replaces oncogenic c-MYC with L-MYC; utilizes a thermodynamically stabilized KLF4 variant.
* **Methodology:** Validated in-silico using the **Glenda Computational Stack** (OpenMM, AMBER14, Xavier, Crucible).

## 🔍 How to Verify (Don't Trust, Verify)

You can independently audit the cryptographic proofs using the provided script.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8+

### Verification Steps
1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/glenda-yamanaka-verification.git](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/glenda-yamanaka-verification.git)
    cd glenda-yamanaka-verification
    ```

2.  Run the verification script:
    ```bash
    python verify_zk_proof.py
    ```

3.  **Expected Output:**
    The script will verify the SHA-256 chain and confirm the integrity of the physics data.
    > `✓ Proof verification PASSED`

4.  **Manual Hash Check:**
    Compare the validation hash in the logs against our public anchor:
    `cb577b2263326bbf21aed8444b7600cce1bc55fc79729b6cb55635f95b7c4024`

## ⚖️ Legal & IP Notice

**Patent Pending (USPTO).**

This repository constitutes a **Non-Enabling Public Disclosure**.
* **Protected:** The specific amino acid sequence, linker optimizations, and engineered mutations are proprietary and hidden via cryptographic hashing (SHA-256).
* **Public:** The performance metrics, validation logic, and proof of existence are open source.

*Reverse engineering the sequence from the hash is computationally infeasible.*
